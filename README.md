# Capterra Code Challenge
I added some values to the JSON, to test for various conditions.

## TO RUN THE TESTS
ruby solution_spec.rb

## TO RUN THE CODE
ruby solution.rb

## OTHER DETAILS
- the output of the algorithm is in result-set.txt
- comments are in the gemfile regarding the external libraries that were used and why
- comments are also throughout the solution.rb

## Git Repo
- I started working on this August 18th, 2018. My git history confirms this

## Compression
- I don't make tarballs often, I usually use 7z
- This is the command I ran 7z a -ttar -so capterra.tar ./ | 7z a -si solution_mclamb_donald.tgz (https://superuser.com/questions/339931/how-do-i-use-7-zip-for-windows-to-create-tar-gz-archives)
- I will send a regular zip in case there are issues with that too
